# pandas_profiling
Pandas_profiling provide efficient methods to perform data analysis. :computer::bar_chart::clipboard:

In this report, I practise using pandas_profiling to build interactive :bookmark_tabs:widget report and :page_with_curl:HTML report. Explain the :bar_chart:visualisation and :books:statistics. Save the report as HTML file and json file. :sparkles:

The '.ipynb' file is the source file and can be opened & run in Jupyter Notebook.\
The '.html' file is a report in HTML format and can be opened as a webpage.\
The '.json' file is a json file containing the data of this project.
