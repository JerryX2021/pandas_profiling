# pandas_profiling
Pandas_profiling provide efficient methods to perform data analysis. :computer::bar_chart::clipboard:

In this report, I practise using pandas_profiling to build interactive :bookmark_tabs:widget report and :page_with_curl:HTML report. Explain the :bar_chart:visualisation and :books:statistics. Save the report as HTML file and json file. :sparkles:

The '.ipynb' file is the source file and can be opened & run in Jupyter Notebook. Interactive widget report and HTML report can be viewed in Jupyter Notebook. The '.html' report and the '.json' data file are saved and supplied in this repository.\
I'm in the way to find solution to share interactive widget report on GitHub, or is there any solution at all :question::scream_cat:\
I provide some sample views from the widget report to show how we can interact with widget report to obtain the interested info quickly.\
